<h1>About Me</h1>

<img src="assets/Headshot.jpg" width = "300px" ALIGN="left" HSPACE="20px">

<p>When I was a kid, I was fascinated by computers.  My father was a “computer operator,” a job that doesn’t exist today since EVERYONE is a “computer operator.” I got to go into his work a few times and was captivated by the technology.  My passion grew from there, and by age 31, I was developing for front and back end at Boeing as a self-taught programmer.
Even when I wasn’t at work, I coded for fun.  As an avid hockey fan, I developed a database that could reliably predict weekly player performance. Using that information, I astounded my hockey-watching friends with my “knowledge of the game.”  Don’t tell them!  
After founding, launching, directing, and developing programming for an educational not-for-profit, I’m returning to the IT world in January after brushing up on the current languages and standards.  The passion from when I was young visiting my dad’s office has never left me.
